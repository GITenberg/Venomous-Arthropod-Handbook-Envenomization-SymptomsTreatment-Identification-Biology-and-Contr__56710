<p>Although most residents of the United States are aware
of the pain and discomfort associated with contacting a
venomous arthropod, many are not aware that these
arthropods (such as ants, bees, wasps, spiders, and
scorpions) are responsible for more human deaths in the
United States each year than any other group of venomous
animals, including snakes. In fact, a study by
Parrish<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_15">15</a></sup> showed that venomous arthropods accounted
for more than 65% of the reported human fatalities
caused by venomous animals in the United States from
1950 through 1959. His findings are summarized as
follows:</p>
<table class="center" summary="">

<p>It would be incorrect, however, to assume from the above
information that a high percentage of arthropod envenomizations
are fatal. In actuality, the opposite is true.
Of the estimated millions of people envenomized by
arthropods in the United States each year, about 25,000
have severe reactions; and of these, approximately
30 result in reported deaths.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_19">19</a></sup> Therefore, the high number
of fatalities caused by venomous arthropods, relative
to other venomous animals, can be attributed to the
high incidence of arthropod envenomizations rather than
the efficient killing power of their venoms. This high-incidence
rate is accounted for by the tremendous abundance
of venomous arthropods and their ability to live
in close proximity to man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>Air Force personnel stationed in the continental United
States face a greater risk of contacting a venomous arthropod
than the average United States resident because:
(1) a large portion of bases are located in the southern
half of the United States, where venomous arthropods
are most numerous; (2) many facilities (such as radar,
communications, security, and missile sites) are located
in remote areas where venomous arthropods are not controlled;
(3) numerous Air Force training and work activities
must be performed outside; and (4) many military
structures (such as older wooden buildings, storage buildings,
and field training facilities) provide excellent habitats
for venomous arthropods. It is important, therefore,
that Air Force medical facilities have current information
available concerning the most important venomous arthropods
in their areas.</p>
<p>The venomous arthropods discussed in this handbook
were selected for inclusion due to the relative severity
of their envenomizations and/or the high frequency of
their contact with humans. It should be stressed that
other arthropods found in the United States are capable
of producing envenomization reactions in humans. Regardless,
all venomous arthropods found in the United
States can be categorized under one of the three types
of envenomization methods described in this handbook:
(1) biting/piercing, (2) stinging, and (3) urticating/vesicating.
The biting/piercing arthropods inject a toxin
through an apparatus associated with or near their
mouthparts; and the stinging arthropods, through a
stinger located at the posterior end of the abdomen.
Urticating and vesicating arthropods are grouped together
because they both release their toxins on contact.
They differ in that the urticating arthropods usually release
their toxin through venomous hairs; and vesicating
arthropods carry a toxic substance within their system,
which is released through small body openings.</p>
<p>To facilitate the utilization of this handbook, each venomous
arthropod presentation has been organized into
the following information categories:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&bull; <b>Identification.</b> Bringing the arthropod causing an envenomization
to the medical facility treating the victim
is most helpful. In most cases, an identification must be
made before the proper form of treatment can be determined.
To assist personnel with identification, the key
characteristics and representative color photographs are
provided for the venomous arthropods discussed.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Distribution.</b> Most arthropod envenomizations occur
during the warm plant-growing season when venomous
arthropods are most numerous. Since the Southern United
States has the longest growing season, venomous arthropods
are abundant for a longer period of time in this
region. Also, the moderate climate of the Southern States,
with fewer weather extremes, permits a greater variety
of venomous arthropods to survive, propagate, and produce
multiple generations each year. Specific regional
occurrences are indicated.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Biology/Behavior.</b> Pertinent biological information is
provided to help increase the reader&rsquo;s awareness and
understanding of venomous arthropods. These factors
are essential in developing a good avoidance and control
program.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Avoidance/Control.</b> To assist in preventing envenomization
accidents, several means of avoidance are
listed for each venomous arthropod. Since the status of
insecticide recommendations is constantly changing, few
specific recommendations are included. When insecticide
control is necessary, an Air Force, County Extension
Service, or United States Department of Agriculture
entomologist should be consulted for current recommendations.
Any insecticide must be applied according to
the instructions on the container label.</p>
<p class="tb">In addition to the information presented in the text, a
table on envenomization reactions and treatment is included
as an <a href="#c21">appendix</a>. The reactions listed in this table
are &ldquo;typical&rdquo; and do not necessarily represent the entire
range of reactions which might occur.</p>

<h3 id="c3">1. BLACK WIDOW SPIDER
<br /><span class="i hst">(Latrodectus mactans)</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="394" />
</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> The female black widow has a shiny
black body, approximately 1.5 cm (0.6 in) long, and
usually a red hourglass-shaped marking on the underside
of her globose abdomen. On some individuals the
distinct hourglass marking is replaced with several triangles
or spots or an irregular longitudinal blotch. She
has slim black legs with a span of 4 cm (1.5 in). The
male is considerably smaller than the female, usually
a patterned brown color, and is not a threat to man.</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> <i>Latrodectus mactans</i> is found in every
state except Alaska; however, most reported human
fatalities have occurred in the Southeastern States.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_14">14</a>, <a class="bib" href="#bib_15">15</a></sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> The black widow is generally found
in its irregular-shaped web near the ground. Common
web sites are under stones, loose bark, or water faucets
or in wood piles, rodent burrows, garages, storage buildings,
outhouses, and barns. Most human envenomizations
occur when the spider is inadvertently trapped
against part of the body or when the web is accidentally
touched.</p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> Frequent cleaning to remove spiders
and their webs from buildings and outdoor living areas
will decrease the possibility of accidental bites. Routine
hose washings of potential spider habitats, such as under
steps and around windows and doors, will discourage
the black widow from locating in these places. When
working in spider-infested areas, wear gloves and a
long-sleeved shirt. If warranted, the outside or inside
of a building may be sprayed with an approved insecticide.
Apply the spray around windows, stairs, closets,
or other spider habitats in accordance with instructions
on the manufacturer&rsquo;s label.</p>

<h3 id="c4">2. BROWN RECLUSE SPIDER
<br /><span class="i hst">(Loxosceles reclusa)</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="393" />
</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> The brown recluse is a medium-sized spider
with a 2- to 4-cm (0.8-1.6 in) legspan and a color range
from yellow tan to dark brown. The most distinguishing
characteristics are six eyes (most spiders have eight eyes)
arranged in a semicircle of three pairs on top of the
head, and a violin-shaped marking extending from the
area of the eyes to the abdomen.</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> Brown recluse spiders occur throughout an
area of the Southcentral States, including Alabama, Arkansas,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Missouri,
Tennessee, and Texas. Localized populations of this
spider, probably imported from the Southcentral States,
have been reported from Arizona, Wyoming, California,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Florida, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and
Washington, D.C. Due to the mobility of the United
States citizenry, specimens can be easily transported in
household goods from the spider&rsquo;s home range in the
Southcentral United States to any other area of the country.
Under favorable conditions the relocated spiders can
survive for an extended period of time and possibly become
established.</p>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> Within its range, the brown recluse
spider will readily establish populations inside parts of
buildings which are generally dry, littered, and undisturbed
for long periods of time. The spider also can be
found outside in protected areas (under rocks and loose
bark). Members of this species are nonaggressive and
normally attempt to escape whenever they are threatened.
Thus, most instances of bites occur when the spider
is inadvertently trapped, such as when the victim puts
on clothing in which the spider is hiding, steps on a
wandering spider at night, or cleans closets or other
storage areas where the spider resides.</p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> Any of the following actions will
help prevent contact with the brown recluse spider:
shake out clothing and bedding before use; eliminate
collections of papers and unused boxes; thoroughly clean
beneath and behind furniture; remove spiders, webs,
and egg cases from living and storage areas; and properly
use appropriate insecticides.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h3 id="c5">3. CENTIPEDES
<br /><span class="i hst">(Class: Chilopoda)</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="395" />
</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> Centipedes are multisegmented elongate
arthropods with a distinct head and one pair of legs, or
appendages, per segment. Size is species dependent,
with body length ranging from approximately 2.5 to 25
cm (1-10 in) or more. The number of legs can therefore
vary from 15 to 100 pairs or more, depending upon the
species.</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> The range of centipedes varies with the
species; however, these arthropods are most numerous
in the southern half of the United States.</p>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> Throughout the day, centipedes hide
under rocks, boards, or bark and in cracks, crevices,
closets, basements, and other moist, protected locations.
At night, they come out of hiding to hunt for prey which
usually consists of insects and other small arthropods.
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Centipedes inject venom through two powerful claws
located on the ventral side of the body immediately
behind the head. Contrary to popular belief, centipedes
cannot inject venom through their numerous legs. The
majority of centipedes found in the United States are
small and not a threat to man. Human centipede envenomizations
occur when a relatively large centipede
is accidentally picked up, stepped on, or otherwise trapped
against the body.</p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> When camping in a centipede-infested
area, carefully invert and shake out sleeping
bags, clothes, or other items left in contact with the
ground. Always wear shoes when walking about at
night, and wear leather gloves when moving rocks or
trash from the ground. Usually centipedes are not sufficiently
numerous in any one location to warrant chemical
control.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c6">4. CONENOSE OR KISSING BUGS
<br /><span class="i hst">(<i>Triatoma</i> spp.)</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="394" />
</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> Species of the genus <i>Triatoma</i> have the
elongate (cone-shaped) head which is characteristic of
the family Reduviidae. Hence, the name &ldquo;conenose bugs&rdquo;
is often used to describe these insects. Orange and black
markings are usually present where the abdomen extends
laterally past the folded wings. These insects are
flattened dorsally, and this trait allows them to effectively
hide in small cracks and crevices. The size of mature
adults varies from approximately 1 to 3 cm (0.4-1.2 in)
depending upon the species.</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> <i>Triatoma</i> species that attack humans are
generally located in the southern half of the United
States.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> Conenose bugs are nocturnal insects.
They take their blood meals at night and hide in any
available crack or crevice between feedings. <i>Triatoma</i>,
as a group, normally feed on small mammals; but in
the absence of their preferred hosts, several species will
readily feed on humans. They are commonly referred to
as &ldquo;kissing bugs&rdquo; because their blood meals are occasionally
taken from the area around the human lips.
Some of the common sites of human attack, in order of
frequency, are the hands, arms, feet, head, and trunk.
This feeding pattern can be expected since kissing bugs
have not been found to feed through clothing.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_30">30</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> Since these bugs can feed undetected
on a sleeping victim, it is difficult to avoid their
attack in heavily infested areas. Exposure to kissing
bugs can be minimized, however, by destroying underbrush,
rubbish, wood rats&rsquo; nests, and any other small-animal
habitat located near a residence.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_27">27</a></sup> When an
infestation is detected inside a house, two or three treatments
with an appropriate insecticide at 10-day intervals
should provide control. To obtain the best results,
thoroughly treat all windows, baseboards, walls, cracks,
crevices, and bedsprings.</p>

<h3 id="c7">5. WHEEL BUG
<br /><span class="i hst">(<i>Arilus cristatus</i>)</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="392" />
</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> <i>Arilus cristatus</i> has the small narrow head
characteristic of the Reduviidae family of Hemiptera
(true bugs). This insect is mouse gray in color and approximately
2.5 to 4 cm (1-1.6 in) long. A cogwheel-like
crest on the dorsal side of the prothorax is distinctive to
this insect and accounts for its popular name, &ldquo;wheel
bug.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> Wheel bugs are generally found in the
southern two-thirds of the United States.</p>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> Wheel bugs are predacious on soft-bodied
insects. Human envenomizations are usually the
result of accidental contact while handling vegetation,
boards, or other objects. The bug penetrates the skin
with its &ldquo;beak,&rdquo; or proboscis, and injects a salivary fluid
normally used in killing its insect prey.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_31">31</a></sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> The best way to prevent wheel bug
contact is to be able to identify this unusual insect and
avoid it. Children should be instructed not to handle it.
Wearing leather gloves while working outside will prevent
bites which occur when the wheel bug is accidentally
picked up with vegetation or other debris. Since
wheel bugs are predacious on many harmful insects and
are generally considered beneficial, control is not recommended.</p>
<p><b>Envenomization Reaction/Treatment.</b> Wheel bug bites
are characterized by immediate intense pain which
usually subsides in 3 to 6 hours. Since all reported bite
reactions have been localized and self-limiting, specific
treatment measures are not provided for <i>A. cristatus</i>
bites. However, anaphylactic shock has resulted from
the bite of other Hemiptera and should be considered a
possibility with wheel bug bites.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_12">12</a></sup></p>

<p class="pcap">Harvester Ant Mound</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> Like other Hymenoptera, females of
dangerous ant species have a stinger at the posterior tip
of the abdomen. Their constricted &ldquo;waist&rdquo; between the
thorax and posterior abdomen and their elbowed antennae
distinguish them from similar insects. The dangerous
United States species belong to genera <i>Solenopsis</i> (fire
ants) or <i>Pogonomyrmex</i> (harvester ants). The easiest
way to distinguish these ants is by their mounds. Fire
ants build elevated earthen mounds 8-90 cm (3-36 in)
high, leaving the surrounding vegetation relatively undisturbed.
In contrast, harvester ant mounds are usually
flat or slightly elevated and are surrounded by a defoliated
area 0.6-3 m (2-10 ft) or more in diameter. Also,
harvester ants are 2 to 3 times larger than fire ants.</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> The Florida harvester ant, <i>P. badius</i>, distributed
throughout the Southeastern States, is the only
harvester ant known to occur east of the Mississippi
River. West of the Mississippi, the red harvester ant
(<i>P. barbatus</i>), the California harvester ant (<i>P. californicus</i>),
and the western harvester ant (<i>P. occidentalis</i>)
are found in different individualized distribution areas.
The two most important fire ant species were introduced
into the United States from South America. The red
imported fire ant (<i>S. invicta</i>) was introduced about 1940
and is well established in the Southeastern States. Currently,
this ant infests Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina,
and Texas. The black imported fire ant (<i>S. richteri</i>)
was introduced about 1918; its distribution is limited
to an area in northeastern Mississippi and northwestern
Alabama. Two less important native species, <i>S. geminata</i>
(tropical or native fire ant) and <i>S. xyloni</i> (southern fire
ant), occur in localized areas of a few southern states.</p>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> Ants of the <i>Solenopsis</i> and <i>Pogonomyrmex</i>
genera are diurnal soil-inhabiting insects that
prefer to nest in open areas. These ants are social insects;
their colonies consist of at least one reproductive
queen, several males, and many nonreproductive female
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
workers. Fire and harvester ants are particularly dangerous
because workers defending their nest can inflict
repeated stings, and multiple human envenomizations
may occur when a victim comes in contact with a mound.</p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> Familiarization with the appearance
of the ant mounds is necessary in order to avoid them
and prevent accidental envenomizations. Since small
children are often the victims of multiple stings, parents
should insure that the mounds of dangerous ant species
are not present in play areas. This is particularly important
where the red imported fire ant occurs. Mound
treatments with mirex have been effective in controlling
<i>Solenopsis</i> and <i>Pogonomyrmex</i> ants. The Environmental
Protection Agency limits the use of this insecticide, and
it must be applied in strict accordance with EPA and
product label instructions.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 id="c10">2. BEES
<br /><span class="i hst">(Order: Hymenoptera; Family: Apidae)</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="393" />
</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> Two families of bees are commonly associated
with human envenomization: Apidae (honey
bees and bumble bees) and Halictidae (sweat bees).
Only the honey bees and bumble bees are considered
dangerous. Both are robust hairy insects with
two pairs of membranous wings which they hold at an
angular position over the body when at rest. Microscopic
examination shows that bee thoracic hairs are individually
&ldquo;feathered.&rdquo; In contrast, wasp thoracic hairs are
smooth.</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> Dangerous species of bees are distributed
throughout the United States.</p>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior. 1. Honey Bees.</b> Since these insects
are not native to this continent, north of Mexico, all original
honey bee colonies in the United States were imported.
<i>Apis mellifera</i>, the cosmopolitan bee of commerce,
is responsible for most bee stings and many
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
deaths.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_10">10</a></sup> This species is separated into several races,
with the gold Italian and the black or gray Caucasian
races making up the majority of the bees found in this
country.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_5">5</a></sup> The aggressive Brazilian (hybrid African) bee
is currently restricted to the South American continent.
Honey bees are highly social insects. Their colony consists
of an egg-laying queen, drones to fertilize the
queen, and workers to gather food and care for the
young. Honey bees can release &ldquo;alarm odors&rdquo; associated
with the sting gland, which cause other bees in the
vicinity of an odor-marked victim to attack and inflict
multiple stings. Unlike other hymenopterous insects, the
honey bee worker has a barbed stinger and can sting
only once; to escape, the bee must leave its entire stinging
apparatus attached to the skin of its victim. As important
pollinators of crops, honey bees are very beneficial
to man.</p>
<p><b>2. Bumble Bees.</b> The bumble bees are considered to be
the most primitive of the social bees. Their colonies lack
much of the structure and highly evolved behavior of the
honey bees; however, like the honey bees, the bumble
bees are diurnal plant feeders and important pollinators
of crops. A typical colony consists of at least one queen,
several males, and numerous workers. Only young fertilized
queens survive the winter to establish new colonies
the next spring. The nests are normally located
deep in undisturbed ground, like fence rows, and are
supplied with a mixture of pollen and honey. During
late summer, a colony usually contains between 100 and
500 bees. Although bumble bees are 2 to 3 times larger
than honey bees, they are neither as aggressive nor as
abundant as the honey bees, and therefore not as dangerous.</p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> The best way to avoid Hymenoptera
stings is to prevent human contact with these insects.
This is especially important for persons hypersensitive to
bee venom. Some preventive steps are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p><b>1</b> Avoid outdoor activities in unfamiliar areas where
stinging insects are known to occur.</p>
<p><b>2</b> When outdoors, don&rsquo;t use floral-scented cosmetic products
or leave sweet beverages or foods exposed in areas
where they might attract bees.</p>
<p><b>3</b> Avoid garbage collection areas, which attract Hymenoptera.</p>
<p><b>4</b> When outdoors, always wear shoes and, if possible,
a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, or other protective clothing.
Don&rsquo;t wear clothing with a bright floral print or
loose-fitting clothing in which stinging insects may be
trapped.</p>
<p><b>5</b> Don&rsquo;t make rapid movements around stinging insects
or intentionally disturb either the insects or their nests.</p>
<p><b>6</b> Eliminate all Hymenoptera nests around inhabited
areas (wild honey bee colonies may be removed by a
local beekeeper). When necessary, an insecticide such as
5% carbaryl dust may be applied in a nesting area within
a building to eliminate the nuisance colony.</p>
<p><b>7</b> Educate young children on the hazards of venomous
arthropods.</p>

<h3 id="c11">3. SCORPIONS
<br /><span class="i hst">(Class: Arachnida; Order: Scorpionida)</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="390" />
</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> Scorpions are crablike in appearance, with
pincers attached to their two front appendages. They
also possess a five-segmented &ldquo;tail&rdquo; terminating in a
bulbous structure with a prominent stinger. The body
size of mature scorpions varies from 2 to 10 cm (0.8-4 in)
or more, depending upon the species.</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> Scorpions are most prevalent in warmer climates.
In the United States the two most dangerous scorpion
species, <i>Centruroides sculpturatus</i> and <i>C. gertschi</i>,
have been found only in Arizona.</p>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> During daylight hours scorpions hide
under objects or debris on the ground. At night, they
come out of hiding to search for food, which consists
primarily of ground-inhabiting arthropods. The prey is
grasped with the pincers and stung by rapidly bringing
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
the stinger forward directly over the head. This quick
stinging motion is also used for defense, as is usually
the case with human envenomizations.</p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> To avoid stings in scorpion-infested
areas: remove accumulations of boards, rocks, and other
debris; wear leather gloves to remove any item from the
ground; inspect and shake out clothing or shoes before
donning them; and when moving about at night, turn
on lights to avoid contacting these nocturnally active
arthropods. Insecticides that are commonly used for
household cockroach control are also useful for controlling
scorpions. Special care should be taken to treat
around all baseboards thoroughly.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="388" />
</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> Female velvet ants, wingless and antlike
in appearance, are actually wasps that only resemble
ants. The males are winged and usually larger than the
females. Both male and female are covered with a velvety
pubescence which is normally bright red, orange,
or yellow. The female has a formidable stinger at the
posterior end of her abdomen which she can use to inflict
a painful envenomization. The length of a mature
mutillid wasp varies from 1 to 2.5 cm (0.4-1 in). In some
localities, mutillids are commonly referred to as cow
killers, mule killers, or wooly ants.</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> The Mutillidae is a large family with most
species distributed in the southern and western parts of
the United States.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_2">2</a></sup> However, one species, <i>Dasymutilla

<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> Female velvet ants are solitary, diurnal,
parasitic wasps. An efficient stinging apparatus and
an extremely thick exoskeleton allow the female mutillid
to conspicuously, yet safely, run about in the open
searching for a suitable place to lay her eggs. Most cases
of human envenomization occur when the female wasp
is accidentally touched while roaming about on the
ground or is trapped against the body in clothing or
bedding.</p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> The solitary and roaming nature of
velvet ants makes it very difficult to predict or designate
ways to avoid contacting them. In areas like the beaches
of Lake Erie where mutillids are known to frequent, however,
potential victims should be made aware of the
velvet ant hazard and how to avoid accidental envenomization.
Since mutillids are not gregarious and do not
congregate in accessible places, chemical control is not
feasible.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> This information applies to all dangerous
wasps found in the United States except the mutillids
(previously discussed). Wasps are elongate insects with
three distinct body parts and four wings. As with all
winged forms of Hymenoptera, the front pair of wings
is larger than the hind pair. Only the female wasps are
equipped with a stinger at the posterior end of the abdomen.
To distinguish wasps from similar-appearing bees,
the specimen&rsquo;s thoracic hairs should be examined microscopically
to determine if they are smooth (a wasp) or
feathered (a bee). In the United States, members of the
paper-wasp family (Vespidae) are generally considered
to be the most dangerous because of their social nesting
habits, aggressive behavior, and abundance. Two
representative members of the Vespidae family found in
North America are the bald-faced hornet, <i>Vespula maculata</i>,
and a common yellow jacket, <i>V. pennsylvanica</i>.
Although it takes an expert to identify most wasps
according to species, the paperlike nests of the vespids
make their identification easy. Another important group
of dangerous wasps easily distinguished by their nests
are the mud daubers. These wasps usually build their
mud nests in the corners of man-made structures. Besides
their distinctive nests, mud daubers are identified
by their dark shiny color and long narrow waist.</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> Dangerous species of wasps can be found
throughout the United States.</p>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> Most vespids are social insects that
feed primarily on other arthropods. These wasps build
paperlike nests by masticating wood fiber into pulp. In
addition to the social wasps, many types of solitary
wasps are capable of envenomization; but these wasps
are easy to avoid since they are neither abundant nor
aggressive. Female members of the dangerous wasp
species will readily attack and inject their venom if someone
disturbs or annoys them. Wasp stingers do not become
detached, and a single wasp can sting a victim
several times before retreating. Social wasps are particularly
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
dangerous because a disturbance of their nest
may result in attack by numerous wasps.</p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> Avoid garbage accumulation sites,
which attract wasps. To avoid wasp stings, recognizing
the nests of the dangerous species in the local area, is
important. If possible, remove and destroy all nests
found around inhabited areas. Wasps can be controlled
by treating their nests with insecticide&mdash;preferably
at night, when the wasps are least active. Treat nests
found above the ground with a commercial wasp spray
or other insecticide recommended by an entomologist.
To treat wasp nests in the ground or in houses, a 5%
carbaryl dust may be used.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_38">38</a></sup></p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="389" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> The Meloidae are narrow elongate beetles
characterized by a &ldquo;neck&rdquo; (pronotum) which is distinctly
narrower than its head or wings. Adult beetles range in
body length from 1 to 2 cm (0.4-0.8 in) and vary considerably
in their coloration.</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> In general, blister beetles are found in greater
numbers in the western half of the United States.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_5">5</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> The immature stages of the blister
beetle are usually predacious on other insects and are
not harmful to man. Adult blister beetles release a clear
amber fluid by rupture of thin membranes in the leg
joints or other segmented areas of the body. The release
of this fluid, which contains a vesicating agent called
cantharidin, is triggered by pressure against the body
of the beetle. Light pressure exerted by clothing or by
brushing off a beetle is usually sufficient to cause the
release of its vesicating fluid. The adult blister beetles
are readily attracted to bright white light, and many
cases of human exposure occur at night around such
lights. Since the adults are plant feeders, some cases of
human vesication occur as persons move through vegetation
infested with blister beetles.</p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> In areas with an abundance of blister
beetles, use yellow light bulbs for outdoor lighting. If a
meloid beetle lands on the skin, blow it off, do not crush
it. Since cantharidin is distributed throughout the beetle&rsquo;s
body, crushing the beetle against exposed skin would
result in maximum cantharidin exposure. Dermatoses
resulting from blister beetle contact are seasonal, with
the greatest number of vesicating incidents in the United
States occurring in July, August, and September. Chemical
control usually is not recommended because of the
mobility and wide distribution of blister beetles.</p>
<p><b>Envenomization Reaction/Treatment.</b> This information is
not included in the appendix because the envenomization
reaction generally consists of a superficial linear bulla
which does not require emergency treatment.</p>

<h3 id="c17">a. IO MOTH CATERPILLAR
<br /><span class="i hst">(<i>Automeris io</i>)</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="394" />
</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> The <i>Automeris io</i> caterpillar is the larva
of the Io moth, which belongs to the moth family Saturniidae.
A full-grown caterpillar is about 5 to 8 cm (2-3 in) long, pale
green, with lateral strips of red or maroon
over white running the length of the body. Near the
center of each body segment is a partial row of tubercles
armed with radiating green and black spines. Many of
these spines are venomous, and their tips are connected
to rather large individualized poison glands.</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> In the United States, the Io moth is found
in the states east of the Rocky Mountains.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_68">68</a></sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> Io moth larvae feed on the leaves of a
variety of plants, including corn and willow.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_17">17</a></sup> In most
areas they produce only one annual generation, emerging
as a moth in the spring or summer and overwintering
as a pupa. In south Texas, however, two generations
occur, with one developing in May-July and the second
in October-December. Therefore, the urticating larval
stages can be found anytime from early spring to late
fall, depending upon the area of the country and climatic
conditions. As with most urticating caterpillars, <i>A. io</i>
envenomizations normally occur when the victim inadvertently
contacts caterpillar-infested vegetation. At the
instant the victim&rsquo;s skin touches this caterpillar, the spine
tips break off in the skin, thus allowing toxin to flow out
of the hollow spines and onto the skin.</p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> Wear gloves, a long-sleeved shirt,
and long pants when working in an infested area. Children
should be warned not to handle caterpillars. If
necessary, infested vegetation may be treated with an
appropriate insecticide.</p>

<h3 id="c18">b. PUSS CATERPILLAR
<br /><span class="i hst">(Megalopyge opercularis)</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="397" />
</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> The puss caterpillar is the larva of a lepidopterous
group commonly referred to as &ldquo;flannel
moths.&rdquo; In some parts of the United States the larva is
incorrectly referred to as an &ldquo;asp.&rdquo; When fully mature,
the larvae are near white to dark gray in color, 2 to 3 cm
(0.8-1.2 in) long, and completely covered dorsolaterally
with hairs that cause them to resemble elongate tufts of
cotton. Some of the hairs are venomous, and when they
penetrate the skin a &ldquo;toxin&rdquo; passes from an underlying
gland through the hairs at the points of contact. The
color variation of the larvae in this species is dependent
upon larval age, locality, and time of year. In Texas,
where this species is most abundant, the spring/summer
generation of caterpillars is usually lighter in color than
the fall generation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> This species has been recorded primarily
from the Southeastern States, including Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi,
Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and
Virginia.</p>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> In most of the southern area of its
range, the puss caterpillar is thought to have two generations
per year. The first generation develops in the
spring and early summer, while the second generation
develops in the fall. After emerging from a cocoon and
mating, the female moth lays her eggs on a suitable
host plant. In a few days the eggs hatch into larvae,
which develop by feeding on the leaves of a wide range
of trees and shrubs. The natural enemies of the puss
caterpillar usually keep its numbers under control; however,
every 4 or 5 years the caterpillars become more
numerous, and the number of envenomizations associated
with them increases.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_66">66</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> Always wear protective clothing
such as gloves and a long-sleeved shirt when working in
areas heavily infested with puss caterpillars. During periods
of <i>M. opercularis</i> abundance, children should be
instructed to stay away from infested trees and shrubs
and not to handle caterpillars. If necessary, heavy puss
caterpillar infestations may be treated with an appropriate
insecticide.</p>

<h3 id="c19">c. SADDLEBACK CATERPILLAR
<br /><span class="i hst">(<i>Sibine stimulea</i>)</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="397" />
</div>
<p><b>Identification.</b> The saddleback caterpillar is easy to recognize
since its brown sluglike body is covered mid-dorsally
with markings that resemble a brown or purplish saddle
sitting on a green and white saddle blanket. Upon close
examination, stout spines can be observed along the
caterpillar&rsquo;s lateral body margin and on its four tubercles.
Many of these spines are hairs that are connected
at their bases with individual poison glands.
Just prior to pupation and subsequent development into
a moth, the caterpillar is 2-3 cm (0.8-1.2 in) long.</p>
<p><b>Distribution.</b> In general, the saddleback caterpillar in
the United States is distributed southeast of a diagonal
line drawn from Massachusetts through the middle of
Texas.<sup><a class="bib" href="#bib_68">68</a></sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p><b>Biology/Behavior.</b> From May to November, <i>Sibine stimulea</i>
caterpillars may be found feeding on the leaves
of a large variety of trees, shrubs, and other plants.
Envenomization usually occurs when the victim accidentally
contacts vegetation infested with these caterpillars.
At the instant the victim&rsquo;s skin contacts the caterpillar, the
spine tips break off, thus allowing toxin to flow out of
the hollow spines and into or onto the skin.</p>
<p><b>Avoidance/Control.</b> When working in infested areas,
wear gloves, a long-sleeved shirt, and long pants to
prevent accidental envenomization. During periods of
local heavy infestations, children should be instructed to
avoid trees, shrubs, and other vegetation commonly infested
with these caterpillars. Local entomologists may
be contacted to obtain information on the most effective
insecticide for saddleback caterpillar control in a given
area.</p>

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
